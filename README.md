# **Settlers of Catan**

## **Project Description**

*Catan is a 2-4 PvP strategy game where each player builds up their villages to earn points in order to defeat others by exceeding the point limit.*

*Game starts clockwise from the highest dice rolling player. Each player starts to place one village and one road to their choice of point on the board. When the turn comes to the last player, the last player immediately puts down two willages and two roads and the game turn changes into counter clockwise. This way, the first player ends up choosing the first settlement on the board while also having the last word to choose the last settlement point.*

*After the board is set up, each player tries to win the game by exceeding the point limit. To exceed the point limit, players can spread their network of roads, create new settlements and upgrade the existing ones while using their resources. However, each player would not have access to all of the resources at all times. Because of this, each player must carefully plan their strategies by being open to trading their resources with other players. When a player reaches the point limit in their turn, that player wins the game.*

*Players gain resources by harvesting the sources denoted by the dice at the beginning of each turn. Nevertheless, when the number 7 is denoted by the dice, shenanigan happens as players having resource cards more than 7 discards half of their resources while the dice roller gets to disable a harvesting heaxgon on the board. Along with trading, Settlers of Catan offers players interesting gameplay. May the luckiest player with the best strategy win the game!*
